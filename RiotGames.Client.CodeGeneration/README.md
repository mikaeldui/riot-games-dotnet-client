This program generates code for the endpoints and models using the unofficial [Open API specification](https://www.mingweisamuel.com/riotapi-schema/tool/). 

It's simply using Roslyn to generate the code. A guide can be found here: https://carlos.mendible.com/2017/03/02/create-a-class-with-net-core-and-roslyn/
