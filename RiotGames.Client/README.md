This project features base code, like the basic HTTP functionality. Endpoints and models are created by running the RiotGames.Client.CodeGeneration program.

In the root we have the RiotGamesClient as well as most of the base classes all the client need, like the RiotGamesHttpClient and RiotGamesClientBase.

Things specific to the games are in their respecitve folders.
