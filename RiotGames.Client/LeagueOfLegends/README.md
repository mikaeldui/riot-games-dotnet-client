This folder contains clients and models needed to communicate with the API's related to the Riot Games game League of Legends.

First we have the normal API for pulling, for example, match history or masteries. This is done with the LeagueOfLegendsClient.

Then we'll have to build a client for the LCU and for the game itself and probably for more things.
